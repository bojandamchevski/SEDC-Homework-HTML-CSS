                <p>The new Leica Nova TS60 total station is the world’s most accurate total station, designed to tackle
                    your most demanding projects. The ground-breaking angular accuracy of 0.5” (sub-second) and distance
                    accuracy of 0.6mm + 1ppm (sub-millimetre) enables you to work at the same high performance levels,
                    even in the harshest of conditions. Be it in rain, fog, dust, sun, heat shimmer or reflections, the
                    TS60 offers the fastest re-lock in case of an interrupted line of sight.</p>
                <p>The new TS60 comes with Leica Captivate, an onboard software with easy-to-use apps that covers all
                    your measurement tasks. It helps turn complex data intuitively into the most realistic and workable
                    3D models. To make your workflow even more productive, the Dynamic Lock functionality is now
                    integrated into the TS60 - it automatically locks onto moving prisms, eliminating the need for
                    standing around and waiting. Setup your instrument faster with the revolutionary AutoHeight
                    feature;simply press a button and start working on your next project.</p>
                <p>When to use the Leica Nova TS60:</p>

                <p>The Leica BLK360 captures the world around you with full-colour panoramic images overlaid on a
                    high-accuracy point cloud. Simple to use with the single push of one button, the BLK360 is the
                    smallest and lightest imaging laser scanner of its kind. Anyone who can operate an iPad can now
                    capture the world around them with high resolution 3D panoramic images.</p>
                <p>Using Leica Cyclone FIELD 360 mobile-device app, the BLK360 streams image and point cloud data to an
                    iPad or final project data to Cyclone REGISTER 360 or Cyclone REGISTER 360 (BLK Edition) via Wi-Fi.
                    With automated workflows in both software offerings, the BLK360 plus the software solution of your
                    choice, dramatically streamlines the reality capture process thereby opening this technology to
                    non-surveying individuals. Simple export of LGS or RCP files makes working with point cloud data
                    downstream in the Leica Geosystems and Autodesk suites simple and efficient, allowing users to spend

                <p>The Leica TerrainMapper-2 is the latest linear-mode LiDAR airborne sensor providing the highest
                    performance for regional mapping projects. Thanks to gateless MPiA, the sensor system delivers
                    outstanding accuracy, unmatched point density and even point distribution even in mountainous
                    terrain. The system is designed to offer the maximum flexibility for all applications from
                    narrow-swath corridors to high altitude applications over complex and changing environments for the
                    delivery of highest fidelity data.

                    The TerrainMapper-2 includes a 2 MHz LiDAR sensor combined with two nadir 150 MP cameras in RGB and
                    NIR. With the integration of the most innovative optical system on the market this new LiDAR sensor
                    delivers high quality images with every flight. Even during long collection days and low sun angles,
                    the integrated camera will keep up with the LiDAR.</p>
                <p>Seamlessly upgradable for urban mapping</p>
                <p>The sensor can easily be upgraded with four additional oblique cameras turning the system into a 3D
                    city mapping machine. This configuration is known as the Leica CityMapper-2. The unique modularity
                    offers users a long-term upgrade path as their our business continues to grow.</p>

                    fast data collection and an easy workflow that guides you through your project lifecycle providing
                    you quick access to critical information to perform your day-to-day work.</p>
                <p>Strong Partnership</p>
                <p>The UAV used for the Leica Aibot surveying and mapping solution is provided by DJI, the world's
                    leading manufacturer of UAVs. Together with Leica Geosystems, they build a strong partnership that
                    drives UAV adoption in the surveying and construction industries.</p>
                <p>System Integration</p>
                <p>Strong system integration plays a vital role in delivering aerial data capture solutions. By fully
                    leveraging DJI's innovative aerial devices with Leica Geosystems extensive expertise in high
                    accuracy measurement sensors, the full potential of UAV technology will be unlocked.</p>
                <p>The Future Surveyor</p>
                <p>Developments created by this partnership help those operating in the surveying and construction
                    industries who adopt the latest technology and software to help make the most informed decisions
                    possible. The future surveyor will make use of UAV technology.</p>
